<!-- centered and italic --> Introduction.
	IN a bowlder of Triassic sandstone which the glacier car-
ried two or three miles, possibly, and deposited not far from
the site of Mount Holyoke College, the writer recently found
an excellently preserved skeleton of a small dinosaur the 
length of whose body is about 18cm<!-- cm is superscript -->. The bowlder was split
along the plane in which the fossil lies and part of the bones
are in one half and part in the other. These bones are hollow
and the whole framework is very light and delicate.
	As the fossil lies in the rock, most of the bones are in posi-
tion, or nearly so, with the exception of the skull and the tail.
A detached tail that probably belongs to this specimen lies a
few centimeters from the rest of the skeleton and near it are 
three very thing bones that may belong to the skull (fig, 3,
A, B, and C; Pl. IV, fig.3). Two of these bones are bilat-
erally symmetrical and one of them is broadly convex with 
a well-defined median sulcus. They are all more or less
embedded in the rock and cannot be described until the rock

	† A paper giving a preliminary description of this fossil was read at the
meeting of the Paleontological Society in Pittsburgh, in December, 1910. In 
that paper the conclusion reached was that the animal was a herbivorious
dinosaur : but that work of developing. which is being done at Yale Uni-
versity, has shown that the bone that was then described as the right fibula,
displaced, cannot be a fibula, and, notwithstanding its great length, it is 
described in this paper as the pubis, in position. The bone that was 
thought then to be two bones, the pubis lying over the ischium, is probably
the ischium with a well-developed ridge as is seen in Compsognathus.
There would be, therefore, no bone to call the postpubis and the form must 
be removed from the herbivorous group of dinosaurs.

	In the description which follows these features are to be
noted: Light construction—hollow bones; slender, straight 
femur; position of fourth trochanter; position of fibula, lying
 close to the tibia; great length of tibia and metatarsals; small humerus; narrow shaft of ischium; great length of pubis; length of vertebrae.
	<!-- italics -->Forelimb.—<!-- end italic -->The humerus (fig. 1, H.)* is a very delicately
shaped bone, 42mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long (not quite half the length of the femur),
slender and well rounded, with high radial crest. The proxi-
mal end shows a slight constriction above the crest and below
the bone tapers gradually to a diameter of 3mm<!-- mm is superscript --> at the distal
end. Measured through the crest it is 8mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. There is a trace
of the impression of the radius or ulna just below the distal end. 
	In the scapular region is a broad, flat bone, lying vertically
in the rock, but twisted on its long axis at a right angle, mid-
way of its length (fig. 1, S.). This bone has a length, as shown, of 20mm<!-- mm is superscript --> and a width of at least 3mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. Lying near 
its proximal end is another flat bone, 8mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long by 5mm<!-- mm is superscript --> wide.
These may be three separate bones, more or less firmly united
in the living animal. Further development is necessary, how-
ever, to bring out their outlines and their relation to each
other.
	<!-- italics-->Hindlimb.—<!-- end italics -->The femur (fig. 1, R. F. and L. F.) is slender 
and nearly straight with thin walls. The bone is expanded on
the back side at the distal end. The length is 86mm<!-- mm is superscript --> and the
diameter, just distalwards from the fourth trochanter, is 6.5mm<!-- mm is superscript -->.
The fourth trochanter (fig. 1, T.) is 18mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long and about 2mm<!-- mm is superscript -->
high and is situated just beyond the middle of the shaft,
toward the distal end.
	Only the proximal end of the right tibia (fig. 1, R. T.) is
exposed and there the bone is well rounded. This, however,
may be only a small part of the proximal end, as the bone is lengthwise, part of the bone lying in each half of the bowlder.
It is an almost straight, narrow shaft with the surface lying
uppermost bent slightly at the proximal end, due, probably, to
the expansion of the bone. In the position in which it lies,
the bone is of nearly the same diameter throughout, about 7mm<!-- mm is superscript -->.
Its length is 104mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. Lying close against the tibia and of 
almost equal length is the extremely thin fibula (fig. 1, L. Fib.). 
	There is a small, convex bone, 4mm<!-- mm is superscript --> by 6mm<!-- mm is superscript -->, lying where the

right tibia and metatarsals should meet, that may be the astrag-
alus (fig. 1, A.). It shows no sign of an ascending process.
	Two of the right metatarsals (fig. 1, R. Met.) lie in position.
Their diameter is 2.5mm<!-- mm is superscript --> and 3.5mm<!-- mm is superscript -->, respectively, along the shaft, 
but at the distal end there is an expansion to a diameter of 
5mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. In position, at the distal end of the left tibia there is 
one metatarsal (fig. 1, L. Met.) slightly curved and 65mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long.
Alongside are traces of a second. One of the digits (fig. 1, D.),
whose divisions are indistinctly shown, lies between two ribs
not far from the right metatarsals. It is 20mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long and 1.5mm<!-- mm is superscript -->
in diameter and is terminated by an ungual 7mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long. Cross
sections of two bones near this one look like unguals.

pubis (fig. 1 and fig 2. P.) is a remarkably long, thin bone,
95mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long, expanded at the distal end. The bone seems to be in position and make an angle of about 40° with the long of 
the vertebral column. Its length is comparable with that of a new, undescribed form from northern Württemberg.
	The ischium (Pl. IV, fig. 2; fig. 1 and fig. 2, Is.) is well
rounded, anteriorly, and has a shaft 4mm<!-- mm is superscript --> wide of which a length
of 30mm<!-- mm is superscript --> is exposed.* The distal end is embedded in the rock.

* The illustrations seem to indicate the presence of two bones but this
may be due to the presence of a ridge on the ischium, and is seen in Comp-
sognathus.

The contact with the ilium and the acetabular edge is
obscurely visible.
	There is a bone running posteriorly from the head of the 
right femur which may be the posterior process of the ilium
(fig. 1 and fig. 2, Il.), the anterior process being covered by the 
femur. This posterior extension can be traced indistinctly for
27mm<!-- mm is superscript --> and either points upward or continues the line of the
posterior part of the vertebral column.

and hollow, and some, at least, slightly concave at each end.
The presacral vertebrae are slender, the measurements for the
sixth presacral being 4mm<!-- mm is superscript --> from end to end. A strong, grace-
fully curved neural spine (fig. 1, N. S.) rises from the vertebrae
in the dorsal region, about 10mm<!-- mm is superscript --> high and 12mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long at the
the others and those at the anterior end of the column, much
stronger. One of the latter measures 10mm<!-- mm is superscript --> at the end and the
diameter through the middle of the centrum is only a little
less. They are not so long, however, measuring only from 12mm<!-- mm is superscript -->
to 13mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. One of these vertebrae is shown in cross section at a
thin edge of the rock and has a transverse diameter through

	The caudal vertebrae are only a little expanded at the ends and are very slender throughout their length. A typical one is 17mm<!-- mm is superscript -->
long with a diameter of 4mm<!-- mm is superscript --> at the ends. The neural spines, if
such they are (fig. 3, D.—G.), are of different shapes. These
caudal vertebrae are so nearly of a size, one with another, that

there is no apparent tapering of the series and
it is not clear which is the proximal end of
the tail nor is it possible, as yet, to estimate
its length.
	<!-- italics -->Ribs.—<!-- end italics -->Quite a number of ribs (fig. 1, R.)
are visible, all very slender and hollow, but
the proximal end is not exposed save in one
instance where the bone is so broken that the
outline is not distinct. Near this proximal
end, however, the bone is somewhat concave
and expanded as if it might be bifurcate (fig.
1, R<!-- there's a lil tic mark that I am not sure how to replicate -->). The largest rib uncovered is 52mm<!-- mm is superscript -->
long and 2mm<!-- mm is superscript --> wide toward the proximal end,
while in no place does the thickness seem to
be more than 1mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. The most anterior of the cervical vertebrae preserved have long ribs. 
These are on another piece of the bowlder
and are not figured.
	Just anterior to the distal end of the pubis there is a small
cluster of gently curved abdominal ribs (fig. 1, A. R.), exceed-
ingly slender and dove-tailed as they lie in the rock, the
position due, probably, to slipping. This mass of interlacing
ribs covers a space of 40mm<!-- mm is superscript --> by 23mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. There are at lease eleven
of these ribs on each side of the median line, the largest of
which is 18mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long and so small in diameter that the bone 
looks like a mere thread in the rock. Slender as are these ribs,
they seem to be hollow. 
	<!--italic-->Sternal element (?).—<!-- end italic -->In the center of this mass of abdominal
ribs is a small body that responds to dilute hydrochloric acid,
as do all of the bones. The part exposed measures 5mm<!-- mm is superscript -->by
3mm<!-- mm is superscript -->. This may be one of the sternal elements displaced.
	<!-- italic -->Gastrolith.—<!-- end italics -->Lying 10mm<!-- mm is superscript --> away, and still among these ribs, is 
a small piece of quartz, a flat, well-rounded pebble, 1mm<!-- mm is superscript --> thick
and 10mm<!-- mm is superscript --> long. The width exposed is 4mm<!-- mm is superscript -->, but more of the
pebble is embedded in the rock. There are no other pieces of 
quartz larger than a grain of sand visible in the bowlder, and 
considering this fact, considering, also, its smooth, polished
surface* and its position, the writer concludes that this must

be a gastrolith. This would seemingly be the first record of
gastroliths found with carnivorous dinosaurian remains.

<!-- centered italic section title --> Comparison with other forms.
	<!-- italics-->Herbivorous dinosaurs.—<!-- end italic -->Compared with <!-- italic --> Nanosaurus agilis<!-- end italic -->
Marsh, the oldest known predentate dinosaur, the following
points may be noted:* <!-- italics -->Points of similarity—<!-- end italics -->The femur is
shorter than the tibia, the ribs are very delicate, and the poste-
rior extension of the ilium seems to have the same position.
<!-- italics -->Points of dissimilarity—<!-- end italics -->In this form the femur is most slen-
der and is nearly straight, while in <i>Nanosaurus</i> it is distinctly
curved. In this form, too, the fourth trochanter is much nearer
the distal end of the femur, the metatarsals are more slender
and probably longer, the humerus is relatively much smaller,
the shaft of the ischium is narrower, the pubis has a long ante-
rior extension, and there is no postpubis.
	In <i>Laosaurus consors</i> Marsh,† from the Jurassic, the femur 
is much curved and is more nearly equal in length to the tibia,
while the fourth trochanter is far up toward the proximal end;
the fibula is more bent, curving away from the tibia; the
metatarsals are very much shorter; the prepubis is short and
humerus as this form has but the shape is not the same.
	<i>Hypsilophodon foxii</i> Huxley (fig. 5), of the Wealden, Eng
land. Here we noticed that the main points of difference are 
in the length and position of the pubis, and the presence of a 
postpubis in <i>Hypsilophoson.</i> In <i>Hypsilophodon</i> the femur is
curved, but the fourth trochanter is situated more nearly as this
one is, toward the distal end; the humerus is stouter and
larger in every way with the radial crest much farther from the 
proximal end; the metatarsals are much shorter; the ribs are
very much stronger; the neural spines are of an entirely dif-
ferent shape.
	<i>Carnivorous dinosaurs.—Anchisaurus colurus</i> Marsh,‡ a
very slender, long-limbed carnivore from the same Connecti-
cut valley Triassic, with which this form seems to compare
quite closely in general outline, shows the following differences.
There is a decided difference in the relative lengths of the
femur and tibia, the femur of the large form being much
longer than the tibia. Marsh points out that the long femur
is found in the larger animals of both carnivorous and herbivo-
rus types, while the smaller birdlike forms of both types have
the tibia longer than the femur.§ This small form certainly

helps to confirm his observation. In <i>Anchisaurus</i>, the femur 
is much bent and the fourth trochanter is high up toward the 
proximal end; and all the limb bones are much stronger. The 
pubis of <i>Anchisaurus</i> is shorter, and runs at almost a right
angle to the vertebral column; nor is it expanded at its distal
end, as it is in this form. On the other hand, there is a general
similarity in the size of the corresponding vertebrae, though
those of the caudal region of <i>Anchisaurus</i> are not quite so long and slender.
	<i>Compsognathus longipes</i> Wagner (fig. 6), from the Jurassic
of Bavaria, corresponds quite closely with this form in length
and general proportions of the limbs, in the shape of some of
the neural spines, especially those just anterior to the scapu-
lar region, and in the general shape of the ischium. The pubis
of <i>Compsognathus</i> is much shorter, proportionally, however,
makes a larger angle with the vertebral column, and is much 
more expanded at its distal end. The Shaft of the ischium is 
not so slender not so uniform in width.

<!-- centered, italicized section title --> Classification.
	No attempt at a definite placing of this fossil will be made 
in this paper, but certain conclusions reached by the foregoing 
study will be stated, The fossil is interpreted as that of a 
carnivorous dinosaur because of the length, shape, and position
of the pubis and the absence of a postpubis. Since no jaw
has been found and there is no proof of the presence or absence 
of an ascending process from the astragalus, the determination
of its position among the dinosaurs depends on the character
of the pubis and the presence or absence of a postpubis. The
position and length of the pubis are more nearly like those of 
the carnivores than those of the herbivores, and there seems to 
be no postpubis. The ischium is shaped somewhat like the
 bone in <i>Scelidosaurus harrisoni</i> Owen, that von Huene
describes as the ischium, with a query, however, stating that it 
may be the pubis, nut not accepting that interpretation because 
he can find no obturator foramen.*
	The short, slender humerus and the long, straight hind-
limb bones, together with the well-developed fourth trochanter,
are indicative of bipedalism. the length of the tibia, much
greater than that of the femur, the extreme length of the meta-
tarsals, over half that of the tibia, and the very light construc-
tion of the skeleton, indicate rapid locomotion, which Lull
uses as an indication of adaptation to clumatic conditions, argu-
ing that this animal must have been able to travel fast and

far for water in a semi-arid climate. In support of this inter-
pretation, also may be added barrel's suggestion that the rock
in which the fossil is embedded indicates deposition on a flood-
plain in a semi-arid region. It is significant that many of these
Connecticut valley sandstones that have dinosaur footprints
have also raindrop impressions.
	Through the courtesy of professor Schuchert the specimen 
has been send to the Peabody Museum of Yale University
for development, where further study will be given it by Pro-
fessor Lull, to whom my thanks are due for many suggestions
in regard to the interpretation of this fossil.
