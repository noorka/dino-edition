# Dino in the Hill: a Kids' Digital Edition
Dino in the Hill: a Kids' Digital Edition is a project focused on designing a primary source digital edition for children ages 7-9. This edition will focus on Mignon Talbot's 1911 article introducing the dinosaur *Podokesaurus Holyokensis* to the scientific community. The goal of this edition is to provide an interface that makes historical scientific content more accessible to young scholars through kid-focused information and interface design.
