                    <h1>About the Project</h1>
                    <p>This website is a prototype for the project Dino in the Hill: Designing a Digital Edition for Children. It is my capstone project for the Digital Humanities MA program at Loyola University Chicago. The project is a proposal for a larger project that will build the complete website for the digital edition.</p>
                    <p>Dino in the Hill was inspired by the initiative to name an official Massachusetts state dinosaur. A statewide poll selected the <i>Podokesaurus Holyokensis</i> as the dinosaur discovered in Massachusetts that would be put forth in the legistlation. At the time I knew very little about the dinosaur, but was interested that the scientist who discovered it was a woman. After doing some digging through digial archives I found Mignon Talbot's 1911 article that officially named the dinosaur she discovered. Given the universal appeal of dinosaurs and the timeliness of the topic, I decided to use Talbot's article as the basis for the digital edition.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this edition is to create a reading environement designed for 7-9 year-old children that offers both supplementary information to understand the text and supplementary information to understand the context in which it was produced.</p>
